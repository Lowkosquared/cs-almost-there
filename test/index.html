        <h1> Naruto </h1>
        <p> Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of
          Konohagakure. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the
          day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most
          of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi,
          Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the
          while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years,
          through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja
          regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after,
          the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the
          Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū,
          Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
          He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning
          the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his
          dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影,
          Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).

        <h1>Why did I make this website?</h1>
        <p>I made this website because Naruto became my inspiration in life.
          He inspired because he didn't want to fail.</p>

        <h1>What was my motivation?</h1>
        <p>My motivation was like when I was watching Naruto
          I thought why not make a website about Naruto
          to make him and his creator more popular.</p>
