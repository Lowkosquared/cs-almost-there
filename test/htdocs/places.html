        <h1>Valley of The End</h1>
        <img src="../images/valley.png">
        <p>The Valley of the End (終末の谷, Shūmatsu no Tani, English TV: Final Valley)
          is located close to the border of the Land of Fire and the Land of Sound.
          Shortly after the foundation of Konoha, the Senju's leader, Hashirama Senju became
          the First Hokage, much to the dismay of the fallen Uchiha leader, Madara Uchiha,
          who intended to destroy the village with the forced assistance of Kurama — the Nine-Tails.
          The valley was carved out by Hashirama's Top Transformed Buddha's barrage. The battle
          ended with Hashirama victorious, Madara escaping his death and going into hiding, and
          Kurama being sealed within Hashirama's wife, Mito Uzumaki.<br><br> This is also where Naruto
          and Sasuke had their rematch.</p>

        <h1>Mount Myoboku</h1>
        <img src="../images/myoboku.png">
        <p>Mount Myōboku (妙木山, Myōbokuzan, literally meaning: Mysterious/Exquisite Tree Mountain),
          also known as the "Mountain of Bewilderment" (迷いの山, Mayoi no Yama, Viz: Maze Mountain)
          and the "Land of Toads" (蝦蟇の国, Gama no Kuni), is one of the big three unexplored
          sage regions, a legendary place that is equally as famous as the other two, Shikkotsu
          Forest and Ryūchi Cave. It's the land of toads and the place where all the toads that
          Naruto, Minato, and Jiraiya have summoned live. It is home for huge and small toads alike.
          Mount Myōboku is a rich and beautiful land, whose ultimate authority seems to be the Great
          Toad Sage. Shima and Fukasaku are both elders and sages, and they seem to have an even higher
          authority than Gamabunta himself. <br><br> this is also where Naruto trained for Sage Mode.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Konoha</h1>
        <img src="../images/konoha.png">
        <p>Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, Konohagakure no Sato, English TV: "Village Hidden in the Leaves"
          or "Hidden Leaf Village", literally meaning: Village Hidden by Tree Leaves) is
          the hidden village of the Land of Fire. As the village of one of the Five Great
          Shinobi Countries, Konohagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Hokage, of
          which there have been seven in its history. Konoha resides deep within a forest at
          the base of a mountain known as the Hokage Rock, which has the faces of all those
          who have taken the office of Hokage engraved on it. While generally seen as the
          most powerful of the ninja villages, Konoha has enjoyed many years of relative
          peace and stability.<br><br>This was also where Naruto had a battle with Pain(s).</p>

        <h1>Falls of truth</h1>
        <img src="../images/falls.png">
        <p>The Falls of Truth (真実の滝, Shinjitsu no Taki, Viz: Waterfalls of Truth),
          is a waterfall located on the Island Turtle. There, Killer B trained to control
          the Eight-Tails. The waterfall itself is peculiar in that by sitting on the
          platform at its base and concentrating, the person is transported into their
          mind. Once there, the waterfall becomes a mirror which reflects one's true self.
          This is the first step in the training regime to control the tailed beast.
          Behind the waterfall itself, there exists a temple where jinchūriki can then
          take the next step in controlling their beast.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Moon (Castle of Ostustuki)</h1>
        <img src="../images/tsuki.png">
        <p>Two years after the war, the last surviving member of the Ōtsutsuki clan's branch family,
          Toneri Ōtsutsuki, began moving the Moon toward the Earth so that he could destroy it
          and rebuild a purer world from the ashes. As the Moon began breaking up in the Earth's
          gravity and increasingly raining meteors upon its surface, Konohagakure sent a
          team to rescue Hanabi Hyūga, eventually ending up on the Moon. Toneri was eventually
          defeated by Naruto and Hamura's actual mission was afterwards explained to him by
          Hinata Hyūga. Apologetic, Toneri restored the Moon to its previous orbit and,
          despite an invitation to live on the Earth, stayed on the Moon, vowing that it
          would never threaten the world again.</p>
