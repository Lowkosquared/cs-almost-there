      <h1>Sasuke Uchiha</h1>
      <img src="../images/sasuke.png">
      <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving
        members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi,
        slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them
        by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through
        competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts
        developing his skills.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Sakura">
      <h1>Sakura Haruno</h1>
      <img src="../images/sakura.png">
      <p>Sakura is the only child of Mebuki and Kizashi Haruno. She had an ordinary
        childhood, raised by her parents without any serious tragedy or complications,
        unlike her team members. When she entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls
        in her class started picking on her because of her broad forehead.
        Sakura tried to combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs,
        but this proved to the other girls that it bothered her and caused them to
        tease her even more. Ino Yamanaka, one of her classmates, saw this, and defended
        Sakura from her bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather
        than hide it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Hinata">
      <h1>Hinata Hyuga</h1>
      <img src="../images/hinata.png">
      <p>Hinata is the oldest daughter of Hiashi Hyūga. When she was still a child,
        Hinata was almost kidnapped by the-then Head Ninja of Kumogakure, who was
        visiting Konoha under the guise of signing a peace treaty between their two
        villages. Hiashi killed him and saved Hinata, setting in motion the events that
        would become known as the "Hyūga Affair".</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Kakashi">
      <h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
      <img src="../images/kakashi.png">
      <p>Because his mother died when he was very young,
        Kakashi was raised during his early years by his father,
        Sakumo. Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having
        saved Konoha on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his
        father. During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was enrolled in Konoha's
        Ninja Academy - Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates
        rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous
        consequences for the Land of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the
        teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning his duties. Disgraced,
        Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined
        not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following the Shinobi Rules
        must always take priority.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Madara">
      <h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>
      <img src="../images/madara.png">
      <p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan.
        He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju,
        with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito Uchiha shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before
        his final death.</p>
